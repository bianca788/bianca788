<strong><center>SAMSUNG PRIVACY POLICY</strong></center><br />
<br />
Effective Date: 18th June, 2021<br />
<br />
This Privacy Policy applies to all of our Samsung devices and services, from mobile phones and tablets to TVs, home appliances, online services, and more, collectively called Services.<br />
<br />
It’s important that you check back often for updates to the Privacy Policy. We may update this Privacy Policy periodically to reflect changes in our personal information practices with respect to the Services or changes in applicable law. We’ll post a notice on our website or on your device to notify you in advance of material changes to our Privacy Policy and indicate at the top of the Privacy Policy when it was most recently updated. The most current version of the Privacy Policy will always be available here: <a href="https://account.samsung.com/membership/terms/privacypolicy" target="_blank">https://account.samsung.com/membership/terms/privacypolicy</a>.<br />
<br />
<b id="pp_01"><strong><u>WHAT INFORMATION DO WE COLLECT?</b></strong></u><br />
<br />
Samsung Electronics collects your personal information in a variety of ways.<br />
<br />
<u>Information You Provide Directly</u><br />
<br />
Some Services enable you to give us information directly. For example:<br />
<br />
• When you create an account or profile with us, we may ask for information such as your name, date of birth, or email address.<br />
• If you order a product or paid service from us, we may ask for your name, address, contact information, and shipping and payment information to process your order.<br />
• To provide responses when you contact Customer Service, we may need information to verify your identity and the product you’re inquiring about.<br />
• When you communicate with our Customer Service staff or others, your communications will be transmitted through our systems.<br />
• If you share your contacts, we’ll collect their phone numbers and other contact information to facilitate file sharing and messaging. You can turn off or restrict these features in Settings on your devices.<br />
<br />
<u>Information About Your Use of Services</u><br />
<br />
In addition to the information you provide, we will collect information about your use of our Services through software on your devices and by other means. We will collect:<br />
<br />
• Device information: Your hardware model, device hardware information, IMEI number and other unique device identifiers, phone number, serial number, sales code, access recording, current software version, MCC (Mobile Country Code), MNC (Mobile Network Code), MAC address, IP address, cookies, pixels, subscription information, operating system versions, and settings of the devices you use to access Services.<br />
• Log information: Diagnostic, technical, error, and usage information such as the time and duration of your use of Services, search query terms when you enter search terms into your device in connection with a particular Samsung Service, and any information stored in cookies that we have set on your devices.<br />
• Location information: Your device’s GPS signal or information about nearby Wi-Fi access points and base stations that may be transmitted to us when you use certain Services and enable the Location function.<br />
• Voice information: Recordings of your voice that we make and store on our servers when you enable this function and use voice commands to control a Service, or when you contact our Customer Service team. Note that if we work with a third-party service provider that provides speech-to-text conversion services on our behalf, this provider may receive and store certain voice commands in accordance with the contract concluded between us and our trusted third-party service provider.<br />
• Samsung Keyboard information: The words that you type when you enable Predictive text. This feature may be offered in connection with your Samsung account to synchronise the data for use on your other Samsung mobile devices. You can clear the data by going to the Predictive text settings.<br />
• Viewing Information: The networks, channels, websites visited, and programmes viewed on your devices and the amount of time spent viewing them.<br />
• Other information about your use of Services, such as the apps you use, the websites you visit, and how you interact with content offered through a Service.<br />
<br />
<u>Publicly or Commercially Available or Shared Information</u><br />
<br />
We sometimes gather publicly or commercially available information, including information from social networks you use, and combine this with other information about you so that we can better understand your needs, interests, and preferences. We also sometimes gather information about you when other people provide it using our Services, such as your name and contact information when others send a message to you or share files with you.<br />
<br />
<u>Other Information We Collect</u><br />
<br />
We may also collect other information about you, your devices, or your use of Services that you consent to send us.<br />
<br />
<u>Third-Party Analytics</u><br />
<br />
Through certain Services, we may collect personal information about your online activities on websites and connected devices over time and across third-party websites, devices, apps, and other online features and services. We may use third-party analytics services on the Services, such as those of Google Analytics. The service providers that administer these analytics services help us to analyse your use of the Services and improve the Services. The information we obtain may be disclosed to or collected directly by these providers and other relevant third parties who use the information, for example, to evaluate use of the Services, help administer the Services, and diagnose technical issues. To learn more about Google Analytics, please visit <a href="http://www.google.com/analytics/learn/privacy.html" target="_blank">http://www.google.com/analytics/learn/privacy.html</a> and <a href="https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners" target="_blank">https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners</a>.<br />
<br />
<u>Your Options</u><br />
<br />
You can choose not to provide us with certain types of information, such as information requested as part of registering a Samsung account. In some cases, this may limit your ability to use some Services. We’ll do our best to explain these limitations when we’re asking for your information so you can make an informed decision. For example, Samsung Cloud allows you to back up your information and create a restore point; however, Samsung Cloud was not designed nor intended to store or process sensitive information.<br />
<br />
<b id="pp_02"><strong><u>HOW DO WE USE YOUR INFORMATION?</b></strong></u><br />
<br />
We use the information we collect for the following purposes:<br />
• To help you or your device register for our Services<br />
• To provide a Service or feature you request<br />
• To provide customised content and personalised services based on your past activities on our Services<br />
• To provide customised advertising, promotions, and offers that might interest you on our websites, third-party websites, and online platforms such as social media sites<br />
• To provide promotions and offers by way of direct marketing communications, only where you have given us your separate consent<br />
• To analyse our products and services to help us better understand our customers in order to offer the most relevant communications, services, and experiences to you<br />
• To ask you for your opinions on our products and services and to carry out customer surveys, with your separate consent if required<br />
• To provide software updates, maintenance services, and support for your devices<br />
• To comply with the law and legal processes<br />

<br />
We use and combine the information we collect about you from our Services, devices, or other sources to provide you with a better experience. For example, you can use your Samsung account details not only on the Service you registered with, but other Services which use Samsung accounts. We also use the information you provide directly or through other sources as described above to provide content you may like or that you’ve personalised.<br />
<br />
You have choices about your information. Check out the <a href="#pp_06">WHAT ARE YOUR RIGHTS?</a> section to learn more.<br />

Some of our European Samsung subsidiaries also process your personal information in their countries. Where applicable, the European Samsung subsidiary has its own local Privacy Policy on its website to explain this.<br />
<br />
<b id="pp_03"><strong><u>WHO DO WE SHARE YOUR INFORMATION WITH?</b></strong></u><br />
<br />
We will disclose your information internally within our business, but only to those who need it to further provide Services or to help with your requests.<br />
<br />
We will also disclose your information to the following entities, only to the extent that this will be necessary to provide our Services:<br />
<br />
• Affiliates: Other Samsung Electronics Group companies which we control or own.<br />
• Business Partners: Partners who we work together with to provide you with the Services you’ve requested or bought. For example, we may work with a bank so that you can use one of our Services to make faster and more efficient payments. These business partners control and manage your personal information.<br />
• Service Providers: Carefully selected companies that provide services for or on behalf of us, such as companies that help us with repairs, customer contact centres, customer care activities, advertising (including customised advertising on our websites, third-party websites, or online platforms), conducting customer satisfaction surveys, or billing, or that send emails on our behalf. These providers are also committed to protecting your information.<br />
• Other Parties when Required by Law or as Necessary to Protect Our Services: For example, it may be necessary by law, legal process, or court order from governmental authorities to disclose your information. They may also seek your information from us for the purposes of law enforcement, national security, anti-terrorism, or other issues that are related to public security.<br />
• Other Parties in Connection with Corporate Transactions: We may disclose your information to a third party as part of a merger or transfer, acquisition or sale, or in the event of a bankruptcy.<br />
• Other Parties with Your Consent or at Your Direction: In addition to the disclosures described in this Privacy Policy, we may share information about you with third parties when you separately consent to or request such sharing.<br />
<br />
<b id="pp_04"><strong><u>HOW DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION SECURE?</b></strong></u><br />
<br />
We take data protection seriously. We’ve put in place physical and technical safeguards to keep the information we collect secure. However, please note that although we take reasonable steps to protect your information, no website, Internet transmission, computer system, or wireless connection is completely secure.<br />
<br />
<b id="pp_05"><strong><u>WHERE DO WE SEND YOUR DATA?</b></strong></u><br />
<br />
Your use of our Services will involve the transfer, storage, and processing of your personal information within and outside of your country of residence, consistent with this policy. In particular, your personal information will be transferred to the Republic of Korea. Please note that the data protection and other laws of countries to which your information may be transferred might not be as comprehensive as those in your country.<br />
<br />
[For European Economic Area (EEA) Residents Only]<br />
<br />
In addition, your use of the Services may also involve the transfer, storage, and processing of your personal information to other countries; such countries include, without limitation, countries in the European Economic Area, the United Kingdom, the United States of America, China, Singapore, Vietnam, India, Canada, the Philippines, and Japan.

<br />
Your personal information belongs to you. You can ask us to provide details about what we’ve collected, and you can ask us to delete it or correct any inaccuracies. You can also ask us to restrict or limit processing, sharing, or transfer of your personal information, as well as to provide to you your personal information that we’ve collected so you can use it for your own purposes.

<br />
To make a request concerning your rights or to make an inquiry, contact us. See the <a href="#pp_09">CONTACT US</a> section.<br />
<br />
<b id="pp_07"><strong><u>HOW LONG DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION?</b></strong></u><br />
<br />
We won’t keep your personal information for longer than is necessary for the purpose for which it was collected. This means that information will be destroyed or erased from our systems when it’s no longer required.<br />

We take appropriate steps to ensure that we process and retain information about you based on the following logic:<br />
<br />
1. At least the duration for which the information is used to provide you with a service<br />

<strong>SAMSUNG PRIVACY POLICY – SMART TV SUPPLEMENT</strong><br />
<br />
Samsung’s Smart TV service offers a set of features that provide enhanced video content, customised TV experiences, movies, connections to social networking services, and the ability to control and interact with your Smart TV with voice commands. We collect, use, share, and store information through your Smart TV and the devices connected with your Smart TV in the ways described in the Samsung Privacy Policy. This Supplement provides additional details about the privacy practices of some Smart TV features.<br />
<br />
The Smart TV is designed to enable you to easily find and access video programming and other content. For example, you may access information about live television programmes distributed to you by your cable or satellite operator and on-demand video content offerings distributed by third-party content providers through searchable guides displayed on your Smart TV.<br />
In the case of live television programmes, we determine what content is available to you based in part on your postcode. In addition, the Smart TV helps you find and experience other Smart TV content more relevant to you by highlighting programming and content that is likely to interest you or providing additional services that will enhance your viewing experience. We base these recommendations and additional services on:<br />
• Information about content that you have watched, purchased, downloaded, or streamed through Samsung applications on your Smart TV or other devices (About the TV viewing information please see “<i>Viewing Information Services</i>” section below);<br />
• Information about applications you have accessed through the Smart TV;<br />
• Information about your clicks on the “Like”, “Dislike”, “Watch Now”, and other buttons on your Smart TV;<br />
• The query terms you enter into Smart TV search features, including when you search for particular video content;<br />
• Other Smart TV usage and device information, including, but not limited to, IP address, log data, information that identifies your hardware or software configuration, browser information, and the page(s) you request.<br />
<br />
<i>Viewing Information Services</i><br />
This privacy notice should be read in conjunction with the Samsung Privacy Policy, which also applies to your receipt of customised Smart TV experiences and can be found at <a href="https://account.samsung.com/membership/terms/privacypolicy" target="_blank">https://account.samsung.com/membership/terms/privacypolicy</a>.<br />
In order to provide you with customised Smart TV experiences, some of our features and services will rely on your TV viewing history and Smart TV usage information.<br />
Your TV viewing history includes information about the networks, channels, websites visited, and programmes viewed on your Smart TV and the amount of time spent viewing them.<br />
We may use automatic content recognition (ACR) and other technologies to capture this information. Your Smart TV transfers video snippets or TV tuner information in order to determine the programmes watched.<br />
You may change your privacy choice at any time by going to the settings menu to disable the particular feature or service at your sole discretion, in which case your TV viewing history will cease to be collected for that particular feature or service.<br />
<br />
[For European Economic Area (EEA) Residents Only]<br />
<br />
Your use of our Services will involve the transfer, storage, and processing of your personal information outside of your country of residence, to Korea, consistent with this policy. In addition, your use of the Services may also involve the transfer, storage, and processing of your personal information to other countries; such countries include, without limitation, countries in the European Economic Area, the United States of America, and Canada. Please note that the data protection and other laws of countries outside the European Economic Area to which your information may be transferred might not be as comprehensive as those in your country. We will take appropriate measures, in compliance with applicable law, to ensure that your personal information remains protected. Such measures include the use of Standard Contractual Clauses to safeguard the transfer of data outside of the EEA. For more information, or to obtain a copy of the contractual agreements in place, please contact us at our Privacy Support page (<a href="https://www.samsung.com/request-desk" target="_blank">https://www.samsung.com/request-desk</a>).<br />
Bear in mind, that your privacy choice may affect the availability or quality of the specific viewing information-based service.<br />
<br />
<i>Interest-Based Advertisement Services</i><br />
The Interest-Based Advertisement Services (the “IBA Services”) are designed to provide the ability to obtain and view useful, interactive, and interest-based advertisements about products and services offered by Samsung and third parties on your Samsung Smart TV or across various Samsung and third-party platforms or devices, including linear commercials on the web, mobile devices, and tablets.<br />
<br />
In order to make the advertising on your devices more relevant to you, the IBA Services will rely on your TV viewing history (including information about the networks, channels, websites visited, and programmes viewed on your Samsung Smart TV and the amount of time spent viewing them), Samsung Smart TV usage information, and other statistical data obtained from trusted third-party data sources. We may use automatic content recognition (ACR) and other technologies to capture your TV viewing history.<br />
<br />
Based on the information above we create groups of Samsung Smart TV owners who share similar interests and use these groups for the IBA Services. The information above is used to determine the groups to which your Samsung Smart TV is assigned and thus, which advertisements your devices receive.<br />
<br />
You may disable the IBA Services at any time by visiting the Settings menu on your Samsung Smart TV.<br />
<br />
Please note that your privacy choice with respect to the IBA Services will not affect whether or not you receive or are served with other types of ads and marketing that are not specifically based on TV viewing history or Samsung Smart TV usage information. Those other types of ads and marketing will be based on other information such as generalised location and other estimated or inferred information. They might be less relevant because they are not based on your interests.<br />
<br />
For more detailed information about the IBA Services, please refer to the IBA Services Privacy Notice at the bottom of this Supplement.<br />
<br />
<i>PSID</i><br />
Your Smart TV viewing history and usage information collected for the purposes of providing interest-based advertisements will be linked to a randomised, non-persistent, and resettable device identifier called the Personalised Service ID or “PSID”.<br />
You may reset your PSID at any time by visiting the Settings menu on your Smart TV and, once reset, your Smart TV viewing history and Smart TV usage information with respect to interest-based advertisements will be de-linked from its previous PSID. Bear in mind that if you reset your PSID, the quality of customised and interest-based advertisements may not be fine-tuned.<br />
<br />
<i>Voice Recognition</i><br />
You can control your Smart TV and use many of its features with voice commands.<br />
If you enable Voice Recognition, you can interact with your Smart TV using your voice. To provide the Voice Recognition feature, your voice commands will be transmitted (along with information about your device, including device identifiers) to us and we will convert your voice commands into text to provide the Voice Recognition features. In addition, Samsung may collect voice commands and associated texts so that we can evaluate and improve the features. Samsung will collect your voice commands when you make a specific request to the Smart TV by clicking the activation button either on the remote control or on your screen or by speaking a wake word (e.g. “Hi, Bixby”) and speaking into the microphone on the remote control or Smart TV.<br />
If you do not enable Voice Recognition, you will not be able to use the voice recognition features.<br />
You may disable Voice Recognition data collection at any time by visiting the Settings menu. However, this would prevent you from using the Voice Recognition features.<br />
<br />
For more detailed information about the Voice Recognition, please refer to the Voice Recognition Privacy Notice at the bottom of this Supplement.<br />
<br />
<i>Third Parties</i><br />
Please note that when you watch a video or access applications or content provided by a third party, that provider may collect or receive information about your Smart TV (e.g. its IP address and device identifiers), the requested transaction (e.g. your request to buy or rent the video), and your use of the application or service. Samsung is not responsible for these providers’ privacy or security practices. You should exercise caution and review the privacy statements applicable to the third-party websites and services you use.<br />
<br />
<i>Country-Specific Features</i><br />
Please note that one or more of the features described in this Smart TV Supplement may not be available to you depending on where you live.<br />
<br />
<br />

<strong>INTEREST-BASED ADVERTISEMENT SERVICES PRIVACY NOTICE</strong><br />
<br />
Effective Date: 30th April, 2019<br />
<br />
Samsung Electronics and its affiliated companies respect your concerns about privacy. This Privacy Notice applies to the personal information we collect through the Interest-Based Advertisement Services (the “<strong>IBA Services</strong>”).<br />
<br />
This Privacy Notice provides further, specific information about how your personal information is used in connection with the IBA Services, and should be read in conjunction with the Samsung Privacy Policy, which also applies to your receipt of the IBA Services and can be found at <a href="https://account.samsung.com/membership/terms/privacypolicy" target="_blank">https://account.samsung.com/membership/terms/privacypolicy</a>.<br />
<br />
In this Privacy Notice, we describe the types of information used through Interest-Based Advertisements, how we use the information, and the choices available to you regarding our use of the information and exercising your rights. Samsung is the data controller for the processing of personal information.<br />
<br />
<strong>WHAT ARE THE IBA SERVICES?</strong><br />
The IBA Services are designed to provide the ability to obtain and view useful, interactive, and interest-based advertisements about products and services offered by Samsung and third parties on your Samsung Smart TV or across various Samsung and third-party platforms or devices, including linear commercials on the web, mobile devices, and tablets.<br />
<br />
In order to make the advertising on your devices more relevant to you, the IBA Services will rely on your TV viewing history (including information about the networks, channels, websites visited, and programmes viewed on your Samsung Smart TV and the amount of time spent viewing them), Samsung Smart TV usage information, and other statistical data obtained from trusted third-party data sources. We may use automatic content recognition (ACR) and other technologies to capture your TV viewing history.<br />
<br />
Based on the information above we create groups of Samsung Smart TV owners who share similar interests and use these groups for the IBA Services. The information above is used to determine the groups to which your Samsung Smart TV is assigned and thus, which advertisements your devices receive.<br />
<br />
<strong>PSID</strong><br />
Information about your device usage that is collected for the purposes of providing the IBA Services will be linked to a randomised, non-persistent, and resettable device identifier called the PSID. You may reset your PSID as specified in the YOUR CHOICES section of this Privacy Notice.<br />
<br />
<strong>WHAT INFORMATION DO WE COLLECT?</strong><br />
Through the IBA Services, we obtain information about your devices in various ways. The types of information we obtain include:<br />
• <u>Device Information</u>. We collect information such as your device model, operating system versions, device configurations and settings, IP address, device identifiers, and other identifiers.<br />
• <u>Device Usage and Log Information</u>. We collect information about how, when, and for how long you use your devices, including your interactions with the IBA Services and Samsung and third-party apps and services on the devices (such as a listing of apps on your devices).<br />
• <u>Viewing Information</u>. We collect your TV viewing history. Your TV viewing history includes information about the networks, channels, websites visited, and programmes viewed on your Samsung Smart TV and the amount of time spent viewing them. We may use ACR and other technologies to capture your TV viewing history.<br />
• <u>Statistical Information</u>. We may use statistical information about you or your devices such as generalised location and estimated age group. We obtain this statistical information from commercially available sources (as permitted by law) such as our third-party service providers. We work with third-party service providers only who ensure that this information has been obtained in accordance with applicable law and can be provided to us for use and disclosure.<br />
<br />
Samsung’s servers receive information when you interact with the IBA Services, such as information about your interactions with the IBA Services, your geolocation, and the devices you use to receive the IBA Services.<br />
<br />

<br />
